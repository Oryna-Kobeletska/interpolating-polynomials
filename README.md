# Linear algebra
This repository contains bits of code I have done concerning topics in Linear algebra, including:
 - Creating and plotting an interpolating polynomial for a given data set. 
 - Writing a function which applies elementary row operations to a matrix to turn it into a lower triangular matrix.
